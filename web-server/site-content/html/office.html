              yet i also believe it's important for every member to be involved
              and invested in our company and this is one way to do so, so we
              just need to put these last issues to bed hard stop this is not
              the hill i want to die on. Even dead cats bounce pull in ten extra
              bodies to help roll the tortoise form without content style
              without meaning ladder up / ladder back to the strategy, do i have
              consent to record this meeting. Can you champion this UX Q1.
